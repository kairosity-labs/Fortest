    "background": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, constantly evolves through genetic mutations and recombinations, leading to numerous variants that differ from the original strain.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 variants are categorized based on their genetic mutations and the resulting public health implications. These categories include Variants of Interest (VOI), Variants of Concern (VOC), Variants of High Consequence (VOHC), and Variants Being Monitored (VBM). Each classification represents a different level of threat based on factors such as transmissibility, severity of disease, and impact on diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures. The detailed definitions and criteria for these classifications can be found on the [CDC's variant classifications page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-classifications.html).\n\n - A Variant of Concern (VOC) includes those that show increased transmissibility, more severe disease (e.g., higher hospitalizations or deaths), or significant reduction in neutralization by antibodies from previous infection or vaccination. \n- A Variant of High Consequence (VOHC), a more severe classification, is characterized by clear evidence of significantly reduced effectiveness of medical countermeasures. \n\nCurrently no SARS-CoV-2 variants are designated as VOC or VOHC. The last VOC was Omicron, which emerged in November 2021 and caused a [worldwide wave](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/one-year-since-the-emergence-of-omicron) of cases.

    "question": "Will the US Senate weaken or eliminate the filibuster before January 3, 2029?",
    "id": "36257",
    "source": "metaculus",
    "background": "The US Senate filibuster rule, which requires 60 votes to invoke cloture and bring most legislation to a floor vote, has been a defining feature of Senate procedure for decades. While the filibuster has been modified in recent years\u2014such as in 2013 ([<u>for executive and judicial nominees except the Supreme Court</u>](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/senate-nuclear-filibuster-rules/story?id=20964700)) and 2017 ([<u>for Supreme Court nominees</u>](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/senate-kills-supreme-court-filibuster-in-historic-moment))\u2014the 60-vote requirement for standard legislation has remained intact.\n\nAccording to the US Senate's [power and procedures guide](https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm):\n\n> The Senate tradition of unlimited debate has allowed for the use of the filibuster, a loosely defined term for action designed to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote on a bill, resolution, amendment, or other debatable question. Prior to 1917 the Senate rules did not provide for a way to end debate and force a vote on a measure. That year, the Senate adopted a rule to allow a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster, a procedure known as \"cloture.\" In 1975 the Senate reduced the number of votes required for cloture from two-thirds of senators voting to three-fifths of all senators duly chosen and sworn, or 60 of the 100-member Senate.\n\nThe upshot of the Senate's procedural rules is that it creates a practical requirement that any non-budgetary bill have 60 votes in the chamber to pass. With the Senate at the time of this question being 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats, that means that the vast majority of bills needing passage in the Senate must have at least 7 Democratic votes. One recent example has been the Laken Riley Act, which passed with 64 votes in the Senate, [including](https://rollcall.com/2025/01/20/democrats-senate-laken-riley-act/) 11 Democrats. From the standpoint of the US government, the filibuster serves as a check on the power of the majority party, which becomes especially poignant when one party controls all three of the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate.&#x20;\n\nAccording to political scientist Robert Van Houweling [arguing against](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/06/15/the-filibuster-a-tool-for-compromise-or-a-weapon-against-democracy/) the filibuster when Democrats were in power in 2021, \"The filibuster is straightforwardly anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic.\" At the time the Senate filibuster was blocking Democratic agenda items from being passed, such as the \\$15 minimum wage and improved voting rights legislation. However, in the two months following the January 20, 2025 inauguration of President Donald Trump, Democrats in the Senate used the filibuster to prevent the passage of the following bills:\n\n* Barring transgender girls from competing in female sports ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/us/politics/democrats-transgender-girls-sports.html))\n* Creating criminal penalties for abortion providers ([NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/senate-abortion-vote-republicans.html))&#x20;\n* Imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court due to the ICC's prosecution of Israeli officials for war crimes in Gaza ([CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/28/politics/senate-vote-icc-sanctions/index.html))\n\nSenate rules [were changed](https://www.americanbar.org/advocacy/governmental_legislative_work/publications/governmental_affairs_periodicals/washingtonletter/2013/november/filibuster/) in 2013 to allow a simple majority to invoke cloture on presidential nominees other than the Supreme Court, and then in 2017 the rules were [further changed](https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44819) to Supreme Court justices to be confirmed with a simple majority. From a predictive standpoint it's important to note that filibuster rules themselves can ironically be changed in the Senate through a simple majority vote, in a parliamentary procedure known as the [Nuclear Option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option), which was used in the 2013 and 2017 rule changes.&#x20;\n\nGiven the closely divided nature of the Senate and potential shifts in party control, changes to the filibuster rule during the second Trump term remain a possibility, particularly if a slim Senate majority believes it is necessary to pass key legislative priorities.\n\nIn 2017 during his first term, President Trump called for the Senate to end the filibuster, [tweeting](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/908640949605163010), \"With the ridiculous Filibuster Rule in the Senate, Republicans need 60 votes to pass legislation, rather than 51. Can't get votes, END NOW!\" This was quickly [rebuffed](https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/331597-mcconnell-shoots-down-trumps-call-to-end-the-filibuster/) by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The following year he [renewed his call](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/donald-trump-kill-the-filibuster-677151), which was again [shot down](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/27/mitch-mcconnell-filibuster-trump-678817). During the Biden Administration 2021-2025 there were frequent calls to end the filibuster ([example 1](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/the-filibuster-must-go-restore-majority-rule-to-save-our-democracy/), [example 2](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/case-against-filibuster)), most recently with Kamala Harris [calling for](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123955/kamala-harris-abortion-roe-v-wade-filibuster) ending the filibuster in order to pass federal legislation protecting a woman's right to an abortion. Thusfar since President Trump's election to a second term, Senate Republicans have [expressed strong support](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-promise-protect-senate-filibuster-even-hinders-trumps-agen-rcna179893) for maintaining the filibuster, although Trump himself has remained silent on the issue.\n\n*This forecast question was created by Bright Line Watch, a nonpartisan watchdog group.

This would lower temperatures regionally and globally for several years, and open up new holes in the ozone layer protecting the Earth from harmful radiation, reduce global precipitation by about 10%, trigger crop failures, and result in widespread food shortages.\n\nAccording to [some models](http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/ToonRobockTurcoPhysicsToday.pdf), the smoke would rapidly engulf the Earth and form a dense stratospheric smoke layer. The smoke from a war fought with strategic nuclear weapons would quickly prevent up to 70% of sunlight from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere and 35% of sunlight from reaching the surface of the Southern Hemisphere. Such an enormous loss of warming sunlight would produce Ice Age weather conditions on Earth in a matter of weeks. For a period of 1-3 years following the war, temperatures would fall below freezing every day in the central agricultural zones of North America and Eurasia.\n\nThis could leave some survivors in parts of Australia and New Zealand, but they would be in a very precarious situation and the threat of extinction from other sources would be great. Whether a nuclear winter could cause extinction is currently unclear. Some [models consider total extinction very unlikely](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1775342), and suggest parts of the world would remain habitable.\n\nThese studies consider what is currently the worst-case nuclear exchange, namely, that between the US and Russia.

With St James\u2019 Park executives deciding the crest, that dates back to 1988, is overly elaborate and unsuited to global digital branding requirements, Newcastle are working with designers and consulting fans as they begin rebranding a symbol they believe has become outdated.\n\n###### Guardian: [Newcastle consult fans over plans to redesign \u2018outdated\u2019 club badge](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/newcastle-consult-fans-over-plans-to-redesign-outdated-club-badge)\n\nThe club are not alone in their redesign campaign as badge redesigns to fit the modern era are becoming increasingly common. For example, [Juventus FC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_FC), one of the oldest and most decorated football clubs in the world, [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20170118033701/http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2017/black-and-white-and-more-juventus-future-now-.php) a major logo redesign in 2017, ditching their traditional club badge for an ultra-modern design.\n\nThese modern proposals, along with the accompanying corporate jargon used to justify them, often stand in stark contrast to the traditions that many football fans hold dear. For example, in 2018, Leeds United, one of Britain\u2019s oldest and most popular football clubs, announced a major badge redesign, replacing their traditional emblem for one with a modern twist. However, [widespread backlash](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42803838) from supporters, fellow clubs, and the general public led the club to swiftly abandon the new design, despite months of research and development.",
