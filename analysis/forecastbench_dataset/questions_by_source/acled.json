Protests: in-person public demonstrations of three or more participants in which the participants\n   do not engage in violence, though violence may be used against them;\n3. Riots: violent events where demonstrators or mobs of three or more engage in violent or\n   destructive acts, including but not limited to physical fights, rock throwing, property\n   destruction, etc.;\n4. Explosions/Remote violence: incidents in which one side uses weapon types that, by their nature,\n   are at range and widely destructive;\n5. Violence against civilians: violent events where an organized armed group inflicts violence upon\n   unarmed non-combatants; and\n6. Strategic developments: contextually important information regarding incidents and activities of\n   groups that are not recorded as any of the other event types, yet may trigger future events or\n   contribute to political dynamics within and across states.\n\nDetailed information about the categories can be found at:\nhttps://acleddata.com/knowledge-base/codebook/#acled-events\n",
