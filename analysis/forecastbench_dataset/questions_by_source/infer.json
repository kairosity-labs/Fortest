An exact death toll is not required if credible sources use language clearly indicating the threshold has been met, such as \"more than 20,\" \"at least 25,\" \"dozens,\" or \"hundreds.\" Deaths will be counted cumulatively across all conflict-related incidents occurring between 4 November 2025 and 15 January 2026; all 20 deaths do not need to occur in a single incident.</div><div><br></div><div>Deaths from internal civil unrest, accidents, natural causes, or other incidents not directly resulting from the conflict will not count toward the total.</div><div><br></div><div>If reports from international organizations (UN, ASEAN, etc.) are available, these will be given priority as neutral sources. If Cambodian and Thai government sources report significantly different death tolls, the higher of the two figures will be used.&nbsp;</div>",
